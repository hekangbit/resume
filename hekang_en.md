## **WORK EXPERIENCE**
### **Oct 2019 to present: Shanghai Huawei - compiler and programming language lab<br>**
I am engaged in software research and development of compiler and language virtual machine in Huawei, and have participated in 4 projects in total:
1. Linx Java language virtual machine: Adaptation of OpenJDK to RiscV ISA platform;
2. Performance optimization of Bi sheng compiler based on LLVM;
3. System Verilog EDA simulation tool based on LLVM;
4. EDA synthesis tool (in progress).

### **Jan 2019 to Aug 2019: Axis communication Shanghai R&D site<br>**
Position:  Sr Firmware Engineer

I participated in the development of W100 wearable camera and completed the following tasks: Linux Audio Codec driver adaptation to support camera voice recording function (based on Arm64); Independently completed the development of co-MCU firmware (based on STM32, responsible for Linux system power switch, camera sleep, wake up and power supply mode switch, through AB partition support MCU to achieve online firmware upgrade). Others involve the use of tools like Yocto, systemd daemon maintain work.
